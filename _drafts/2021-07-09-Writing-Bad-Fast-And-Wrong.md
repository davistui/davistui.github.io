## Write as fast, bad and wrong as you can

This has been an important adjustment to my workflow when creating and responding to email. You have a chance to edit your emails before you send them so when you're writing important emails to important people, reduce the expectations that you have in your mind and get everything out on paper. Give yourself a license to put everything onto paper (or screen), don't worry about the grammar or format and most of all, don't worry if it's wrong or information that you'll look to omit, getting it out of the brain is the most important part.
