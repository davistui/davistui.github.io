I wrote [this article](/blog/How-To-Read-More-In-2021) last week about reading more and I thought I'd follow up with some ways you can retain the information in your head. Whilst this is aimed at non-fiction, it's also applicable to fiction books in a creative way which I'll share below:

## Highlighting text doesn't mean you'll remember it.

It might be a habit learned at school but [no evidence](https://www.psychologyinaction.org/psychology-in-action-1/2018/1/8/mythbusters-highlighting-helps-me-study) exists that higlighting text while reading is significantly better. Yes some studies have shown it *helps* from a reference perspective but given most text in a book is important, you can't really go highlighting the whole page.

In the context of digital information, storing what you've higlighted and putting it into a [digital second brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjZSy8s2VEE)

## Implement what you read

When I think about work experience, none of it comes from a single source. It's from a collection of experiences and sources that you've chosen to use or omit. Same thing comes to getting the most out of reading - it's the implementation that is the secret sauce. If you read all the nutrition books in the world but don't do anything to improve your nutrition, then you're not really leveraging any of the knowledge you learnt. An easy question to challenge yourself with is ***what is the lesson that I'm learning and how does this apply to my life***? 

## Talk to people about what you've read

Exchanging ideas and context with others is a great way to explore in deeper detail the concepts that you pick up from the text that you read. This can also serve as inspiration to people you talk to and widen the possibilites of what you can do with these idea.

## Be mindful that the text may have elements of cognitive bias

Cognitive biases are habits in our thinking that make us conclude the wrong things. Things like men writing on behalf of women (head to [**Men Writing Women**](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/) for a laugh), ways situations are framed and a host of other bias may be the reason as to why some bodies of text can arrive to certain conclusions. It's your job as a reader to be challenge the ideas and conepts and get benefit from what you're reading. This links into the fundamental idea in the previous post that:

> *The point of reading is for the book to* **serve** *you, not for you to serve the book. If a book sucks, donâ€™t hesitate to get rid of it.*

## How does this apply to fiction?

I mentioned earlier that this predominantly refers to non-fiction, but how does this apply to fiction books that you read? Fiction books carry lessons we learn about ourselves. Fiction carry pertinent take-away messages and universal themes that can stick with a reader forever. Taking this into a deeper level around insights into yourself. Our ability to identify with the main characters, imagining the world a book is in and connecting with the message. Even understanding why you bought the book is a lesson about yourself.

## Conclusion

It's one thing to read a whole bunch of books and it's another thing to remember what you learnt. Highlighting text doesn't necessarily allow you to remember what you read, it's more
