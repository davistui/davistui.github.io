Working from home in this capacity has been both a blessing and a curse. The ability to scale prospecting and working with existing customers has been life changing. The downside has been the screen burnout and being able to work my soft skills and connecting with people which is a core of what I enjoy about technology sales.

The change in how we work has been challenging my approach to productivity and building more self awareness around being busy versus being productive. It's easy to go down the productivity rabbit hole and I came across this video about [building a second brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjZSy8s2VEE). 

It argues that if we can keep our brains free of distraction, it has the ability to process information at a rate that can create the outcomes we want. We tend to clutter the brain with little bits and pieces of information, important tasks and reminders. This has been more pronounced given we have access to an unlimited amount of information due to the internet.
