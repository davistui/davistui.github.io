## Digital marketing today

This year more than ever, we’re seeing credibility that the internet is a platform that everyone is using. From the meme generating millennials through to the 71 year old president of the United States. With so many eyeballs on digital platforms, we see the incredible opportunity to get amongst them and leverage them to position our businesses.

However when it’s time for your business to jump on board, it’s akin to the Wild West. We read up on content marketing strategies that inspire people to reach your website, SEO agencies promising first page rankings and keyword research that reaches the niches we’re supposed to be speaking with and a boat load of this can be done for free! Sounds a bit too good to be true? Maybe..

The interesting thing with digital marketing is that a lot of us just jump in without realising that it’s a piece of the marketing puzzle. Meaning that the people who look after our digital marketing by default look to make it a stand alone function that’s ‘different’ to the rest of the business. After all - digital marketers still find it difficult to justify there relevance to the business and the marketing function is normally the first place to cut in organisation restructures. So to do two things - maximise the relevance and value, digital marketing always comes down to three areas: understanding the opportunity, the strategy and the resulting execution.

### The opportunity

The opportunity of digital marketing we know is huge. Let’s not bore you with 'digital disruption’ or the ‘internet of things’ part, instead lets look at some basic principles we can lean on to frame the rest of this article. Digital marketing consists of digital efforts to reach people on digital devices, there are a score of digital marketing techniques and ALL digital marketing is data driven.

In most cases we struggle to size up how viable the digital marketing opportunity is for our own existing businesses and brands. How do size the opportunity? There are two sides to this, internal and external data points. Internally, it's in your historical sales data. This is the biggest clue worthy because a receipt can tell a lot about your customers. The value of the transaction, the time of purchase, any upsells, referalls and much more. Putting this in excel for the time being is a great start to visualising this data to allow you to look at what you're working with and lead you to sizing up the opportunity with external data. Where do you find this external data? It all lies within the social platforms and their ad platforms. With your understanding of your ideal customer profile, you can hone into their data points to find out the actual size of the audience you can approach.

## The Strategy

So now that you've got a general idea of what the opportunity looks like, it's time to start looking at a high level strategy. I'll outline the bones of what your strategy should look like in so you can get stuck in. 

### Value proposition
It's starts with your marketing proposition and creating a digital equivalent. Remembering the key concept behind all of this, digital marketing is **one** of your funnels that leads to attracting people within your potential audience and qualifying them to perform an action (sign up to your newsletter, refer someone to your business, visit a physical location) not necessarily perform the sale.

### Digital marketing segmentation
Then you're going to answer the age old who, what, when, where, how and why for your customers. This covers most if not all of what you're trying to achieve from a strategy perspective.

### Benchmarking
Now you know what your value proposition is, the segments you're going to approach and what platforms you're looking to use, the next part is to form your benchmarks. Providing some numbers to what you're looking to execute is the biggest strength you can find in digital marketing. Because the data driven decision making allows your to make slight changes to what you're doing on the execution side of things.

## The Execution

With the strategy taking shape. The execution side is what creates a feedback between your business and the audience that you're trying to reach out to. Normally when businesses start looking into digital marketing here, because this is where google searching leads you to. However this is the part where you can test different aspects of digital marketing (both free and paid) in order to see what works best for you. Here are some practical things you can do for free (before venturing into hiring someone to do it): Search Engine Optimisation (sorting out your sitemap, indexing, permalinks and google places if need), blog planning and posting, social media content creation. Some digital marketing activies that will require a cash investment include hosting your website and the design and getting all your graphics standardised (so that things can be used on different platforms without looking cheesy). The other side that will be an actual investment is paid advertising on the different platforms (I'm talking about linkedin, facebook, twitter etc). Why is this a paid initiative when others are saying that they can get you things done for free? It's because that's the digital world we live in, if you want faster results with your digital activities to get your audience into your funnels - you're gonna have to pay.

### In conclusion
So with the internet continuing to disrupt our lives now more than ever, we can see that there's an opportunity to leverage digital marketing within your organisation. This is found by identifying your ideal customer profile and sizing up the opportunity using tools that you have - internal data points (such as historic sales data) and external data points (social platforms) in order to figure out how to build a strategy for the 

- We know that it's a wild west out there but it's worth it. HOW? Because we know the size of the market and where we fit amongst it. How do we know what we're doing - build the strategy
- Strategy involves realising that digital marketing is no magic pill, it's a sub-activity of marketing which is a business unit which goes through the same checks and balances as other business units.
- Meaning the execution of the entire thing involves execution that you can gather intel and iterate as you're going.


- Allocating budget for things to get fast tracked and allocating time to get things done. Recognising that there are, at times, a mixture of the two. If you want win on quality, speed, price - you're only allowed to pick two.
- The interesting thing that no one talks about with digital marketing is the change management side of things.
- Ensure that it comes from the top down to ensure that you empower people to get things done
