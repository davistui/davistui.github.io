**Hi, I'm Davis.**

I'm a New Zealand-born Samoan living in Melbourne, with a decade of experience in enterprise tech sales. I currently work at Eptura, where I help enterprise organisations implement worktech solutions that streamline operations, enhance space utilisation, and create better experiences for employees across the workplace. For those in the corporate real estate side, you may have come across this with Serraview, Condeco, Proxyclick and Archibus.

Outside of work, I'm a creative with a passion for building my community. Whether it's having a run playing rugby, vlogging my travels, or helping startups/scales ups with GTM knowledge. I try and do things rooted in culture, purpose, and impact.

Over the years, I've built a body of work that spans enterprise strategy, sales enablement, content creation, and cultural advocacy. I write, shoot, build, and sometimes just think out loud. You'll find those thoughts peppered across this website.

## Current Projects:

- 🏉 Growing my rugby club's community engagement through sponsorship and content (check out our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/footscrayrugbyclub/){:target="_blank"} or get in touch if you'd like a sponsorship proposal)
- 📹 Scaling a creative agency focused on storytelling for sports and lifestyle brands - check out my business partner [Wills on IG](https://www.instagram.com/graphic_wilz/){:target="_blank"}
- 💡 Launching a Sales enablement course to help professionals minimse the jump when moving into Enterprise Tech Sales (The Weekly Win Wire - Coming Soon)
- 🌱 Exploring entreprenurialism and its applications to Indigenious and BIPOC in Australia and New Zealand
