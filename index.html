                        <h4>Professional Rugby Player</h4>
                        <p>I spent the last two seasons as a professional rugby player in Bahrain (Middle East). I've always had a passion for rugby having played at a competitive level in New Zealand and Australia but making the transition into a paid player was an entirely exciting experience. Not to mention the change from being a salesperson wearing a suit to wearing sports gear and exercising everyday! As a job, it was quite fulfilling and had to pinch myself when finding myself boarding a flight to go play some rugby. I like sharing some of my experiences with rugby and I wrote a bit about it in my <a href="blog/">blog</a></p>

                        <h4>Digital Marketing Agency </h4>
                        <p>One cool thing about being a rugby player is having a bit more time on your hands. This allowed me to tune into my entrepreneurial side and set up my digital marketing agency <a href= "www.marketingbh.com">Marketing BH</a>! Primarily I focus on <i>boring</i> industries like website and lead generation for Oil & Gas companies. Whilst setting up the agency, I am also working on automating the workload to my team in ordet to get it to run itself.</p>

I always found this an important photo to realise that with all my skills and experience in sales and enteprise IT - Mum always said to stand up straight and smile, probably the most important sales skill I know. The rest of the sales skills I have I've shared them in my <a href="blog/">blog</a> which I hope you will find usefull.</p>
