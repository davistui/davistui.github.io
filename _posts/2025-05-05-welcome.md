Hi, I'm Davis. I have over [**10 years experience**](/resume) working in the enterprise tech space as an account executive, selling into a diverse range of industries across Australia. Over time, I've developed a strong understanding of the complexities involved in buying software—particularly in today's climate where value must be proven across every part of the business. I'm passionate about helping others break into tech sales and become great at it, just as others once helped me. I write about sales enablement, storytelling, process improvement, and how to navigate the modern B2B sales cycle. I also share thoughts on technology and productivity, particularly through the lens of enterprise adoption. While I've previously written about low-code, I'm now more focused on the broader systems that enable digital maturity and commercial outcomes.

Outside of work, I still play [**rugby union**](/posts/why-still-playing-rugby/) and spend time exploring side projects, tools, and strategies that help me think and execute better. If you're like me—curious, driven, and working on getting better—feel free to explore the [**blog**](/archives) or check out my [**resume**](/resume).

Thanks for stopping by.
