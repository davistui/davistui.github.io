<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I am currently an Account Executive with <a href="https://outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a>, an enterprise application development platform. I have closed enterprise deals in Government, Healthcare and Mining. I have also grown one of our sales territories Western Australia (whilst based in Melbourne) into the Country’s fastest growing region.</p>

<p>With the shift into the new normal, my approach to sales has grown into a more consultative approach. Lately, my focus has been on understanding customer pain points and how they prevent organisations achieving their strategic goals. This information guides me to build a bridge between value based outcomes and fair commercial offerings.</p>

<h2 id="key-skills">Key Skills</h2>
<p>✓ Identifying where technology is positively impacting the way organisations build customer centricity and digital agility.</p>

<p>✓ Scaling and developing my own qualified pipeline and territory plan using a range of tools.</p>

<p>✓ Consultative selling (MEDDIC, value maps, enterprise value assessments tools)</p>
