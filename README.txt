Hi there, I'm using jekyll pages to run my blog using a theme that AJ (@n33co | dribbble.com/n33) created.

This is a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios

Icons:
Font Awesome (fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome)

Other:
jQuery (jquery.com)
html5shiv.js (@afarkas @jdalton @jon_neal @rem)
CSS3 Pie (css3pie.com)
skel (getskel.com)

Whilst I'm non-technical, I understand the value of these tools in a digital age. I was originally going to use a tool to port over my notion blog but this is good enough to share my thoughts and my current skillset.

I'm currently in the market looking to take on any new opportunities so happy to share more about my sales and marketing experience in the hypergrowth startup space.
