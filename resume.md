## Overview
*The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VpGOVyfukfy3FHqYYFbynLVbaxdrLzub/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">PDF copy</a> provided is a summarised version, while an expanded version is available below*

I am currently an Account Executive with [OutSystems](https://outsystems.com/), an enterprise application development platform. I have closed enterprise deals in Government, Healthcare and Mining. I have also grown one of our sales territories Western Australia (whilst based in Melbourne) into the Country's fastest growing region.

With the shift into the new normal, my approach to sales has grown into a more consultative approach. Lately, my focus has been on understanding customer pain points and how they prevent organisations achieving their strategic goals. This information guides me to build a bridge between value based outcomes and fair commercial offerings.

## Key Skills

✓ Creating buying visions involves understanding customers' business challenges and goals, and mapping out how products and services can address their specific needs and goals. This approach can help to create a compelling value proposition that motivates customers to move from an intention to a transaction

✓ I have experience in developing and scaling my own qualified pipeline and territory plan using a range of tools including cold calling, email sequences, and in-person thought leadership and presentations. By leveraging these tools, I have been able to successfully grow my sales pipeline and achieve my sales targets.

✓ My experience in consultative selling has involved using frameworks such as MEDDIC, value maps, and enterprise value assessment tools to engage with customers and understand their needs. This approach enables me to create customized solutions that align with the customer's goals and priorities, and build lasting relationships based on trust and mutual value.
