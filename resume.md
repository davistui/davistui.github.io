## Summary

I am currently an Account Executive with [OutSystems](https://outsystems.com/), an enterprise application development platform. I have closed enterprise deals in Government, Healthcare and Mining. I have also grown one of our sales territories Western Australia (whilst based in Melbourne) into the Country's fastest growing region.

With the shift into the new normal, my approach to sales has grown into a more consultative approach. Lately, my focus has been on understanding customer pain points and how they prevent organisations achieving their strategic goals. This information guides me to build a bridge between value based outcomes and fair commercial offerings.

## Key Skills
✓ Identifying where technology is positively impacting the way organisations build customer centricity and digital agility.

✓ Scaling and developing my own qualified pipeline and territory plan using a range of tools.

✓ Consultative selling (MEDDIC, value maps, enterprise value assessments tools)
