Below you'll find a deeper dive into my sales experience.

## Summary

I was onboarded into <a href="https://www.appsmith.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #800080;">Appsmith</a> to build the APAC presence, however my position was made redundant due to a strategic focus on North America. Prior to this, I spent five years working as an Account Executive at <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #800080;">OutSystems</a>, selling their low-code platform to commercial and enterprise customers across different segments. I take a value-based, consultative approach to sales, focusing on delivering solutions that meet customers' needs and drive business results. My experience working at a unicorn startup has broadened my skill set, giving me opportunities to work in areas like marketing, strategic partnerships and business value consulting.

## Key Skills

✓ Creating buying visions involves understanding customers' business challenges and goals, and mapping out how products and services can address their specific needs and goals. This approach can help to create a compelling value proposition that motivates customers to move from an intention to a transaction

✓ I have experience in developing and scaling my own qualified pipeline and territory plan using a range of tools including cold calling, email sequences, and in-person thought leadership and presentations. By leveraging these tools, I have been able to successfully grow my sales pipeline and achieve my sales targets.

✓ My experience in consultative selling has involved using frameworks such as MEDDIC, value maps, and enterprise value assessment tools to engage with customers and understand their needs. This approach enables me to create customized solutions that align with the customer's goals and priorities, and build lasting relationships based on trust and mutual value.
